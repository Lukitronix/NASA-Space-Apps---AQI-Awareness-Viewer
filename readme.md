## Project Summary

We developed the **AQI Awareness Viewer**, a web platform designed to make air quality data accessible and understandable to the general public, highlighting the tangible impacts of climate change.

- **Data Source:** Official NASA TEMPO satellite datasets hosted on AWS S3.
- **Core Feature:** Custom API that processes cloud-hosted data without downloads.
- **Predictive Capability:** Machine learning model trained on a decade of atmospheric data, providing a **48-hour AQI forecast**.
- **Goal:** Transform the platform from a simple viewer into a proactive tool, empowering users to make informed decisions about their health and environment.

## How It Works: From Earth Data to Actionable Insights

### 1. Data Sourcing and Processing
- **Source:** NASA TEMPO Level-3 satellite data.
- **Processing:** AWS cloud-based processing avoids downloading massive datasets.
- **Efficiency:** Users access only processed, relevant AQI information in real-time.

### 2. Custom API
- Bridges NASA data and web front-end.
- Calculates AQI metrics and serves them through structured endpoints.

### 3. Predictive Machine Learning Model
- Built using **VARIMA (Vector Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**.
- Trained on **10+ years of atmospheric data**.
- Provides **48-hour AQI forecasts**.

### 4. User Interface (Front End)
- Clean, intuitive web viewer.
- Visualizations: Maps, charts, and forecasts.
- Designed for **ease of understanding** for non-experts.
